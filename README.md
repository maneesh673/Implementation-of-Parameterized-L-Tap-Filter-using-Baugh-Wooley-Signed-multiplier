# Implementation-of-Parameterized-L-Tap-Filter-using-Baugh-Wooley-Signed-multiplier
The Baugh-Wooley multiplier:
Typical conventional Multipliers have Sign bit extension complexity problem. To avoid this, we will
go for Baugh-Wooley multiplier.
The Baugh-Wooley multiplier is a signed multiplier that takes less complexity to implement.

In the implementation of parameterized L-Tap filter design, I have used signed Baugh wooley multiplier in the
place of multiplier block
